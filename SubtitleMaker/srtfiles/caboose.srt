1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Oooh, ugh.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Come on, Mr. Blue Guy!
You've gotta wake up!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Wake up!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It hurts.  Just let me die.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You can't die, I'm bored!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,500
All these girls want to talk about is chick stuff,

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
and not the fun chick stuff,
like ribbons and unicorns.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
I don't have treads,

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,000
but I often find them staring at things
they really shouldn't be.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You see??  Boring stuff, like oppression, and a hostile work environment.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Get Doc.  I need Doc.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
I can't!  He got possessed by the evil guy and they escaped!

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
He is the one who shot you, don't you remember?

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
I know, I want him to shoot me again.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now now now.  Sounds like someone has a case of the poor me's.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,000
If you were going to die, you would have done it by now.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Maybe, you just need to realize you're
going to have to live with intense pain.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Get that Sarge guy.  Have him make me a new body.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, we can't.  We're out of parts because we overused that joke!

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And Sarge has left with the others to chase Doc!

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't worry, they left a long time ago, so I'm sure they'll be back any minute.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Simmons had a fool-proof plan to catch them.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello...hello?  Is anybody here?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Just great.  I guess we all got separated in the teleporter.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sarge!  This is Simmons 2.0, do you read me?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Apparently your plan to chase Lopez and Doc has failed miserably.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I appear to be stuck in some sort of nexus of teleporters which could take me anywhere in the universe.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Or...it's a janitor's close.  Hell, I don't fucking know.
Sarge, are you there, Sarge!?

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Hello!  Anyone!  Do you read me?

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Do I read you?  Anyone?  Anybody?  Nobody?  Okay.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,500
Well, I don't think the others are coming.  We must have gotten separated somehow.

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,000
My toes...are getting pruny.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,500
Oookay.  Why don't we try to find O'Malley?

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,000
I know where you can find O'Malley.  He lived inside my helmet for a while.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Maybe he left his address to send his mail.  We were like friends.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Sounds like he took some of the furniture when he left.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And the carpet.  And the drapes.  And I wouldn't expect to get that deposit back, if you know what I mean.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,500
Sergeant!  Look!  A sleeping person!

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
What?  Holy macaroni!

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He's not sleeping son, he's dead.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh good.  At first, I thought that was me, 

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,500
because I am blue, and I like to sleep.

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,000
But, if he is dead, that can not be me.  That would be silly.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No doubt he was called by our very enemy.  Once again I find myself torn.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
On the one hand, there's one less Blue in the universe.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But now Doc's got a bigger body count than me!  That just won't do!
So screw it.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Rest in peace, scumbag.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Look!  More sleeping people!  It must be nap time!

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But who has nap time now?  Nap time comes before ?pant? time, not after.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think these people are just making up times.

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
What the Samuel Hell stinky happened here?

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,000
It must have been an enormous battle.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hello!  Is anyone okay?

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are there any survivors?

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Preferably any red survivors?

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Don't let that discourage you from speaking up if you're blue, I won't step on your neck or anything like that.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Am I allowed to answer?

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,000
Sshhh.  Quiet.  Do you here that?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.  That noise is called water.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,500
It is very wet, and very sloshy--

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I was talking about the trumpet, bluetard.

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I have to go to the bathroom now for some reason.

63
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:13,000
Which is odd, because I already went when we were standing in the creek together.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wait a minute, I know that song, that's Reveille!

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why would someone be playing Reveille in the middle of the--

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Yaaaah!!

67
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,000
Sweet gibbly giblets!

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Running time!

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What just happened here?

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think all the sleeping people were trying to--

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That was rhetorical!

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Get over here, give me a boost!

73
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:56,700
Okay!  You are a nice person and people say good things about you.

74
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,500
Not a morale boost, moron, a physical one!

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
I need to see what's in that window!

76
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,500
That window is very high.  I don't think you are tall enough.

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I know, I need you to help me look through it.

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't think I am tall enough either.  Also, my head is round.  That window is square.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Come here, you.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Whoa!

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What do you see?

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I see....a room.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And?? What's in the room?

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There are some walls, and some ceilings...wait, just one ceiling.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's making all that racket?

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
(chanting) Kill the Reds!  Kill the Reds!

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You are not going to like it.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Caboose, I have a very bad feeling about this.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's that?

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Chaaaarge!!

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Come on Caboose, we gotta get to the higher ground.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Come on, Caboose!

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sarge, I am scared of our new friends.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hot 'n sunny bono, what's going on here?

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Stop fighting, stop fighting, everyone stop fighting!

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Everyone, look unto me, I possess the blue flag!

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's more beautiful than I ever imagined!

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I have seen the top of the mountain, and you will worship me as though I were a god!

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I regret nothing!  I lived as few men dare to dream!

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh you fucking camping bitch!

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a legitimate strategy!

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Whoa!
Damn!

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hey Blue, we're the only two left!  Let's work together!

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What do you mean?

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm coming out!
Okay! I'm coming out too!

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What did you mean, we could work as a team?

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I bash you in the head with my rifle, and you die.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Good teamwork, you fucking noob!
Good game, good game everybody, gg man gg!

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I have no earthly idea what it is I just saw or what this place is or where in the hell O'Malley is!

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
My only choice is to blame Griff for coming up with such a flawed plan.  Stupid, stupid Griff.

111
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I am so confused.  Where is Church?  I need Church to tell me what to think.

112
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,000
Church can handle this.  He can handle anything!

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey asshole, for the last time, let me out of this damn jail cell!

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, let him out, he's driving me nuts!

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Aw, shut up Red, nobody asked you!

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I should have never listened to Donut's stupid fucking plan.
