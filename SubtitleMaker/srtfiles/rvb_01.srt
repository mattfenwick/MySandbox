1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Hey.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,100
Yeah?

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,500
You ever wonder why we're here?

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,500
That's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Why are we here?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,500
I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence,

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,000
or is there really a God, watching everything...

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,000
with a plan for us and stuff?

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,000
What?

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,500
I mean, why are we out here, in this canyon

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, uhhhh, I....

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,500
Yeah

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,000
What was all that stuff about God?

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,300
Uhhh....hm?  Nothing.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,300
You wanna talk about it?

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,000
No.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,600
You sure?

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,600
Yeah.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
Seriously, though, why are we out here?

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,000
As far as I can tell,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,500
it's just a box canyon in the middle of nowhere.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,000
no way in or out,

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,000
the only reason that we set up a red base over here

25
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,000
is because they have a blue base over there.

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,000
and the only reason they have a blue base over there

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,000
is because we have a red base over here.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, that's cause we're fighting each other.

29
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,950
No, but, I mean,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
even if we were to pull out today,

31
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,200
and they were to come take our base,

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,000
they would have two bases in the middle of a box canyon,

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Whoop-de-fuckin' doo.

34
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,500
What's up with that, anyway?

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,500
I mean, I signed on to fight some aliens.

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,500
Next thing I know, Masterchief

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,300
blows up the whole Covenant armada

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
and I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere

39
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,300
fightin' a bunch of blue guys.

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
What are they doing?

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,300
What??

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,800
I said, what are they doing now?

43
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,000
God damn, I'm getting so sick

44
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,000
of answering that question.

45
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,200
Hey, you have the fuckin' rifle,

46
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,500
I can't see shit, don't bitch

47
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,500
at me because

48
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm not gonna just sit up here

49
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,500
and play with my dick all day.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Okay, look, they're just standing there,

51
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,500
and talking, okay?

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
That's all they're doing,

53
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
that's all they ever do,

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
is just stand there and talk.

55
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,200
That's what they were doing last week,

56
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
that's what they were doing 

57
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,500
when you asked me five minutes ago.

58
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
So five minutes from now,

59
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
when you ask me, "what are they doin'?",

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
my answer's gonna be, 

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,000
they're still just talkin',

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
and they're still just standin' there.

63
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
What are they talking about?

64
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
You know what?

65
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I fuckin' hate you.

66
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Talk about a waste of resources, 

67
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,800
I mean, we should be out there,

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
finding new and intelligent forms of life,

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
you know, fight them.

70
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, no shit.

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
That's why they should put us in charge.

72
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,800
Ladies!

73
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Front and center on the double!

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
(Fuck.) Yes, sir!
