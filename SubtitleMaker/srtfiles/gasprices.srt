00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
Hi everyone, I'm private Dick Simmons.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,500
And I'm private Church.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
We're here today to talk to you about the soaring cost of energy prices.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Specifically, gasoline.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Gas prices are so high right now

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,800
that some people are having to cut back on basic necessities

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,500
just to afford to drive to work.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Not me, I just quit goin' to work.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
To help understand the seemingly never-ending rising gas prices,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I asked my good friend Church

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to build us a primer to explain

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
the complex economic system behind gasoline production and distribution.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
Yeah, that actually turned out to be a lot more reading than I thought,

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
so I just rented a copy of Mad Max instead.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
From what I can tell, the gas crisis has something to do with people in Australia

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
that really like effiminate bondage.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You knuckleheads have got it COMPLETELY wrong as usual.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
High gas prices aren't caused by supply and demand!

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
It's all the taxes!

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Taxes?

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,000
That's right! Don't you know for every dollar you spend on regular unleaded gasoline,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the government takes 137 cents!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,200
Sir, I think that your math might be a liiiitle off.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,500
And they tax you more for the good stuff!

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,000
That's why mid-grade and premium are exactly 10 cents more per gallon!

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,500
no matter how much regular costs.

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,000
That doesn't make any sense...or wait, does it?

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Besides, everyone knows that gasoline comes from dinosaurs!

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If we're running out of gas, the solution isn't to drive less,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it's to kill more dinosaurs!

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
All the dinosaurs are already dead.

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
It doesn't have to be just dinosaurs, moron!

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,000
Any animal turns into oil when it dies.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
So remember, if you want to be environmentally friendly,

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,000
just kill every living thing you see, and bury it.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
But that process takes millions of years!

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've got time.

38
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Let me out of here!  There's worms!

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Gentlemen, we could debate the fine points all day.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But the fact remains, 

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,600
a gallon of gas still costs less today

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,800
than a gallon of milk.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, but you don't drink three gallons of milk every time you drive to work.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Maybe you don't.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, we may never figure out why gas costs so much,

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
but you can at least take steps to save money.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
First, try cutting out other petroleum-based products besides gasoline,

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
like paraffin wax, loop oil, synthetic latex, and rubber.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Man, Doughnut just saved a ton of money right there.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Of course, the easiest way to save is on your commute.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Like try switching your current daily driver to a smaller vehicle,

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,000
instead of the full-size you probably drive now.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Or you could try carpooling to work.

54
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
or how 'bout this, how 'bout you use your own two feet and walk?

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Ah, don't be a pussy.

56
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Of course, cutting back on the amount of gas you use can be difficult.

57
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,600
Most people have a near insatiable thirst for gas.

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
(sarcastically) I know I do!

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Me too!  I drank two gallons this morning!

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,000
Caboose!  I wasn't using the word 'thirst' literally!

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No...my tummy feels a little weird.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Blaaappp!

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You know, that could actually be a lot of fun at parties.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
Ugh, I'm just glad it came out his mouth.

65
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,800
Hey Simmons, give me a ride back to base!

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes, sir!

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Doh, great.  Has anybody got a gallon of unleaded?

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How about a jug of milk?
