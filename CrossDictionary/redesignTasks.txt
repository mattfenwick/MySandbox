 redesign components:
   parsers:  html response -> parsed definition (or error message if necessary)
   gui:  provide buttons, text entry fields ... display parsed results
   http request code:  requested word -> html response
   glue: connect all the pieces

 data definitions:
   parsed definition (not sure what lowest common denominator is yet -- find out)
     actual word from response
     definitions
     examples
