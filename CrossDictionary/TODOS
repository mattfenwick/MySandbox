high priority:
----------------------------
- "funny characters" not being printed correctly in GUI
- look in to replacing spaces with '+'s -- this seems EXTREMELY error-prone
- work on precise meaning of a "definition"
- make sure it's clear which definition is associated with which dictionary in the GUI!!


low priority:
-----------------------------
- get moving with the dictionary.com API -- still waiting on response from their end
- unit tests should follow perl conventions
- text encoding:  display weird characters in Tk text box
    
    
completed:
-----------------------------  
- work on urban parsing
- grab data from a "definition" and display in GUI (currently just Dumper-ing)
